*The most well-known blockchain application currently owned by Chase is Quorum. This blockchain application uses the Ethereum network for INN ( interbank information network)  a *payments network that involves more than 300 banks. JP Morgan reached out to Conesys in August 2020 to acquire Quorum.

## Landscape
* JP Morgan over the past 5 years has made significant investments in Fintech companies, either purchasing companies or engaging in acquisitions. Notable examples are:
 * We pay – a payment firm for business platforms. Chase directed this acquisition to its small business clients
* Instamed – a medical payments technology firm that gives Chase access to 3.5T healthcare spending market
* This last one was reported by cnbc.com on Sept 2022 JPMorgan (JPM) fintech deal to acquire Renovite to battle Stripe and Block (cnbc.com). JP Chase acquired Renovite to fend off threats from competitors like Stripe or Block 
* JP Morgan has been the most aggressive bank to seek fintech partnerships. His CEO has said numerous times that fintech represents a clear and present danger since fintech is nimbler in adapting to customer preferences, technological advancements, and regulatory support. 

## Results
*JP Morgan entered the fintech market with a scale that a lot of startups in the fintech market *on’t have or may never achieve. Like the Forbes article states JPMorgan Chase: The Real Winner Of The Fintech *Micro-Bubble (forbes.com). Banks have the financial resources, the swath of users and transactional data, necessary regulatory approvals, and customer relationships to sustain a large, technologically driven advantage over small firms. 
* A good example is mentioned in the above article. In Oct 2020 JP Morgan launched Quick accept service intended for businesses to process credit cards through their mobile app or a contact less reader.  That put Chase in direct competition with Square.
* The article also states JP Morgan was able to migrate a large portion of its 3 million existing small business customers into QuickAccept, which gave them more scale in market share that Square had with only just over 2 million customers. 
* Another benefit for customers was that Chase is offering same-day funding on sales made through Quick accept, something Squares charges 1.5% 
* Since JP Morgan has a large customer base this allows them to generate lots of cash which they can turn to technology services that initially can be given for free 
## Recommendations
*JP Morgan needs to continue to invest in fintech technologies that allow them to have cost operations efficiencies. The use of RPA technology to streamline and automate internal processes. For example, continue to seek fintech startups that can help streamline operations or processes *like when 55 ip was acquired to help financial advisors tax efficient portfolios. Source JPMorgan is buying fintech start-up 55ip to help financial advisors offer tax-efficient portfolios (cnbc.com)
* Cost overhead in banks continues to be a good opportunity for JP Morgan to invest in RPA technology to streamline operations taking the same approach as the 55ip acquisition. Given the amount of branch openings, some paperwork processes could still be optimized with *RPA technology. The acquisition of cleareye since paperwork and manual documentation continues to be the main pain point in the trade finance workflow
